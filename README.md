Nova is a free tool for students of sidereal astrology that offers full natal and solunar return calculation, as well as mundane and right ascension analogue chart views and an aspect list. 
<br>
The core calculation routines are handled by the Swiss Ephemeris library and ephemeris files, and are supplemented by traditional sidereal calculations compiled by the community.
