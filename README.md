# Nova
Nova is a free tool for students of sidereal astrology that offers full natal and solunar return calculation, as well as mundane and right ascension analogue chart views and an aspect list. 

The core calculation routines are handled by the Swiss Ephemeris library and ephemeris files, and are supplemented by traditional sidereal calculations compiled by the community.

This project is open source under the GNU General Public License V3.
